# myprofile

## Description

This motivation for this project was to write our own code and practice skills learned in our class.
I wanted to make a profile that included key elements required of us.
We built this project to create a website that has personal information about myself, my projects, and contact information so that people can review my work and connect with me as needed.
This solved the problem of how to store the projects I work on in a consolidated place.
I learned a lot this challenge. I learned the how to set up an html and css doc. I also learned to practice key concepts learned in the firts two modules such as styling, linking, html semantics, and more.


## Installation

This website was built from scratch and has added functionality included such as navigation, and links to my (fake) projects.
